# Unsupervised-learning
Dataset Description:
- types.csv - reference of transaction types
- codes.csv - reference of transaction codes
- transactions.csv - transactional data on banking operations
- train_set.csv - training set with client gender marking (0/1 - client gender)
- test_set.csv - no need to use.


transactions.csv columns description:
- client_id - client is id
- datetime -transaction date (format - ordered day number hh:mm:ss - 421 06:33:15)
- code - transaction code
- type - transaction type
- sum - sum of transaction


I. Explore the dataset. Do the descriptive statistics. <br>
II. Explanatory data analysis. Exploring the features, visualizations etc. <br>
III. Feature engineering. Encodings, generating the features from date-time, sum and
from other columns.<br>
IV. Unsupervised learning. Do the Cluster analysis. Segment the customers. K-means,
Hierarchical Clustering. With different metrics, linkages. Visualize the clusters etc.
Look for the optimal number of the clusters<br>
V. Analyzing the results.<br>
VI. Conclusion.
